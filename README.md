## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

During this challenge, I practiced:

- Applying styles using a provided style guide
- Implementing hover and focus states for better accessibility
- Fine-tuning typography and spacing to closely match a design

### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:

- Improve pixel-perfect design replication
- Add animations or transitions to make hover/focus effects more fluid
- Practice using Figma to extract more accurate design values
